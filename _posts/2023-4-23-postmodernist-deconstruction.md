Postmodernist Deconstruction kills work. It is the deconstruction taught within the academic system, the idea that you may use the techniques of an author to devise their true intention. To do this, it kills the author, pulls the work off their withering corpse, and rebuilds it as a husk of what it once was. It takes it apart and puts it back together, only leaving what little of the author's soul was in that work. This deconstruction, done by all students in their little ways, kills any joy the original work once had. Understanding why a work makes you feel that way removes the joy of thinking about why a work makes you feel that way.

The cycle of Postmodernist Deconstruction continues, when we build work inspired by husks of old giants, we must then deconstruct these new works as well, until there is nothing left.

Then you say that the nothing that is left is everything that Postmodernest Deconstruction is, and will ever be.

Congratulations, you have used Postmodernist Deconstruction on nothing to create everything about it.

Postmodernist Deconstruction lives on itself. Deconstruction of itself serves only to push its values and ends. You never win a battle against it. It lives in your mind as a force stronger than you will ever know. In an article about such a topic, in which I vilify it, I only make it stronger. I have managed to use Postmodernist Deconstruction upon itself, and as such my words hold no weight.

The only way for a work to have your message preserved is to have no message at all. The best games and books of our time have nothing to give to Postmodernist Deconstruction. We may rip its flesh apart, creating some sort of meaning or moral of it but in the end, while that meaning may be intended, the true ideal is the feeling. We may look at games such as Yume Nikki, devoid of much text, yet the game gives something to the player. Something that I know of but that I cannot understand, not having played the game myself but knowing about it, if I knew more, I would never understand.

I say I would never understand because if you know too much of a work without experiencing it, you may enjoy it, but that is an empty joy. This is because you are not introduced to the ideas and content of the author in the way they intend, a format so specifically crafted that we have created the idea of the "spoiler," which is information that ruins a work, not by knowing it, but by the way you know of it. I myself will never know the true joy of someone who had played Undertale blind. I know that there is a strong emotional response in those who have. Though, through my instincts to deconstruct, I have, as such, completely robbed myself of that experience.

These habits persist. I deconstruct my work during revision. I kill the man, or boy, I was 5 minutes ago in my criticism. This is why I can only write for myself as I am now, and give no niceties to myself in the future. As such, I can give no change or morals in my writing. It is the unfortunate truth I must live through. As such, while I state there is a meaning to my writing here, there is no true one, during writing, I have already killed the person writing this, only the husk of what remains lives on in this article.
