The idea of a strawman is not new within the realm of debate. The mischaracterization of someone's argument to attack them has been around since the 1500s (Wikipedia citing that its earliest known origin was in 1520 by Martin Luther). What I wish to explore and what I believe is very poignant at this time is the fact that the strawman is not just a trick while debating: it works out of a debate to rally those of a tribe together under a hatred of one ideology, an ideology that, while it may appear from a distance similar to the one their supposed enemy possesses, it is one fundamentally different than what the reality is.

The idea that one should "know your enemy" is an idea that is preached frequently but practiced rarely. While one may believe that they fully understand the layers of their opponent's beliefs, it is most likely that they have studied the ideologies of the strawman they have unknowingly constructed within their mind. While one with a passion for debate may assume that they will be able to take down opponents with extreme precision, taking down their arguments by attacking the fundamental core of their assumptions. The truth is that even if a strawman holds a sword, it cannot attack you unless you puppeteer it to attack.

Beyond using the strawman to inflate one's perception of their skill in debate, the strawman works to a group together in its ritual burning. What I mean by burning is that within a group, a member may attack a shared strawman, which brings all the members together in their unified hatred of the strawman. I refer to this as burning the strawman. It is a common and effective ritual for the continuation of tribalism; even though I do talk great ill of it, I would be a fool if I did not admit succumbing to such behavior.

However, one may question the idea that all, or nearly all, people in a group share the same strawman. And indeed, it does seem quite unlikely that a group of people, especially a large one, would be so similar in their thoughts. The explanation for this phenomenon is that burning the strawman requires the strawman to share the same dislikeable attributes (ones that cause anger within the group): it is more likely that these traits are relatable to any random person selected from that group. The reason for this odd occurrence is that it is much easier, especially in our modern age where statements are plenty and facts are few, for angry mischaracterizations to spread among a group, where they fester, brought to light only by burning the strawman.

This last part is the main issue with burning the strawman; and the main issue with a strawman in general. The strawman allows for hate, feeds off lies, and loves the hivemind. And that is why we must identify and eradicate it. If we want to work with those we disagree with, we must not be so quick to hold our strawman up and fit the person across from us into the mold we have crafted for them already. It is hard, and I am not good at it at my current time, but I think by writing this article, I not only help myself develop these thoughts but also allow others to learn of them as well, and I hope that my writings will be of some use to people.
